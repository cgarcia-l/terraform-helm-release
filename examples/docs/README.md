Certainly! Here's a README for your Terraform module that deploys Helm charts:
# Terraform Helm Chart Deployment Module

This Terraform module is designed to facilitate the deployment of Helm charts onto Kubernetes clusters. It offers flexibility in configuring various aspects of the deployment, such as repository credentials, chart versions, and custom values.

## Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Terraform installed (version 0.12.x or later)
- AWS provider configured with appropriate credentials
- Kubernetes cluster accessible and configured in the target region

## Provider Configuration

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
```

Adjust the region according to your AWS setup.

## Usage

```hcl
module "example" {
  source = "../../"  # Path to the module directory

  apps = {
    app1 = {
      namespace  = "argocd"
      name       = "argocd"
      repository = "https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm"
      chart      = "argo-cd"
      version    = "v6.7.14"
    },
    app2 = {
      namespace            = "jenkins"
      name                 = "jenkins"
      repository           = "https://charts.jenkins.io"
      chart                = "jenkins"
      version              = "v6.7.14"
      repository_key_file  = "path/to/keyfile"
      repository_cert_file = "path/to/certfile"
      repository_ca_file   = "path/to/cafile"
      repository_username  = "username"
      repository_password  = "password"
      set = [
        {
          name  = "key1"
          value = "value1"
        },
        {
          name  = "key2"
          value = "value2"
        }
      ]
      set_sensitive = [
        {
          path  = "secret1"
          value = "sensitive_value1"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Adjust the values within the `apps` object to match your Helm chart configurations.

## Outputs

This module exposes the following output:

- `deployment`: The state of the Helm deployment.

```hcl
output "deployment" {
  value       = module.example.deployment
  description = "The state of the Helm deployment"
}
```

## Further Customization

Feel free to modify this module to suit your specific deployment needs. You can extend it to include additional configuration options or integrate with other Terraform modules.
